# Model Improvements Summary

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **PHP Enums Created**
- `WorkOrderStatus` - Draft, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled
- `WorkOrderAction` - Delivery, Pickup, Service, Emergency, Other
- `TimePeriod` - AM, PM
- `DriverStatus` - Active, Inactive, Suspended
- `CustomerType` - Residential, Commercial, Industrial

Each enum includes:
- Label method for display
- Color method for UI badges
- Icon method where applicable

### 2. **Query Scopes Added**

#### WorkOrder Model
- `scopeActive()` - Filter draft and in-progress orders
- `scopeCompleted()` - Filter completed orders
- `scopeCancelled()` - Filter cancelled orders
- `scopeForCompany()` - Filter by company ID
- `scopeForDriver()` - Filter by driver ID
- `scopeForCustomer()` - Filter by customer ID
- `scopeToday()` - Filter today's service orders
- `scopeThisWeek()` - Filter this week's orders
- `scopeThisMonth()` - Filter this month's orders
- `scopeDateRange()` - Filter by date range
- `scopeRequiresCOD()` - Filter orders requiring COD
- `scopeSearch()` - Full-text search across multiple fields

#### Driver Model
- `scopeActive()` - Filter active drivers
- `scopeInactive()` - Filter inactive drivers
- `scopeAvailable()` - Filter available drivers
- `scopeForCompany()` - Filter by company
- `scopeCanLiftHeavy()` - Filter drivers who can lift heavy items
- `scopeHasTruckCrane()` - Filter drivers with truck cranes
- `scopeAvailableOn()` - Filter by availability on specific day
- `scopeServicesArea()` - Filter by service area
- `scopeSearch()` - Search across driver fields

#### Customer Model
- `scopeForCompany()` - Filter by company
- `scopeSearch()` - Search across customer fields
- `scopeInZip()` - Filter by ZIP code
- `scopeInCity()` - Filter by city
- `scopeInState()` - Filter by state
- `scopeInCounty()` - Filter by county
- `scopeTaxExempt()` - Filter tax-exempt customers

### 3. **Model Validation Rules**
Each model now has a static `validationRules()` method returning an array of validation rules for consistency across the application.

### 4. **Eager Loading Defaults**
- WorkOrder model auto-loads `customer` and `driver` relationships
- Prevents N+1 query problems

### 5. **Global Scopes for Multi-Tenancy**
All models now have automatic company-based scoping:
- Filters records by current user's company
- Ensures data isolation between tenants
- Can be disabled with `withoutGlobalScope('company')`

### 6. **Enhanced Attribute Casting**
- Enum casting for status fields
- DateTime casting with specific formats
- Decimal casting for monetary values
- Array casting for JSON fields

### 7. **Model Observers**
Created `WorkOrderObserver` to handle:
- Automatic ticket number generation
- Status change logging
- Completed timestamp management
- Activity logging

### 8. **Database Performance Indexes**
Added composite indexes for:
- `(company_id, driver_id, service_date)` - Driver schedule queries
- `created_at` - Recent records queries
- `cod_amount` - COD filtering queries

### 9. **Filament Resource Updates**
- Updated forms to use enum classes
- Updated table filters to use enums
- Badge colors now use enum color methods
- Improved type safety

## Usage Examples

```php
// Using scopes
$activeOrders = WorkOrder::active()->forDriver($driverId)->today()->get();
$availableDrivers = Driver::active()->availableOn('Monday')->servicesArea('Downtown')->get();
$commercialCustomers = Customer::search('acme')->inState('CA')->get();

// Using enums
$order->status = WorkOrderStatus::COMPLETED;
if ($order->status === WorkOrderStatus::DRAFT) {
    // Handle draft status
}

// Using validation rules
$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), WorkOrder::validationRules());

// Query without company scope
$allCompanyOrders = WorkOrder::withoutGlobalScope('company')->get();
```

## Benefits
1. **Better Performance** - Optimized indexes and eager loading
2. **Type Safety** - PHP 8 enums prevent invalid values
3. **Code Reusability** - Query scopes eliminate duplicate query logic
4. **Data Integrity** - Validation rules and database constraints
5. **Multi-Tenancy** - Automatic company isolation
6. **Maintainability** - Centralized business logic in models
7. **Developer Experience** - Intuitive API with autocomplete support

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more specialized scopes as needed
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Add model events for audit logging
4. Consider implementing soft deletes for critical models
5. Add API resources for clean JSON serialization
